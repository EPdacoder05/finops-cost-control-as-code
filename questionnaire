üìã Top DevOps/FinOps Interview Questions & Hints
1. What are the key principles of FinOps, and how do they differ from traditional IT financial management?
Hint: Compare dynamic, iterative cost control in FinOps versus static, up-front budgeting in classic IT. Reference how cost optimization is continuous in cloud, not just planning.

2. Walk me through how your project handled AWS cost control using Infrastructure as Code. What pitfalls did you encounter?
Hint: Describe automation of billing alarms, resource whitelisting, and permission-aware design. Reflect on your IAM permission challenges and how real-time alerting was implemented as a workaround.

3. Cost spikes: If your billing alarms fire off at $0.80, what's your troubleshooting workflow?
Hint: Outline how you‚Äôd use AWS Cost Explorer, resource tagging, instance right-sizing. Connect this to "Hunter Lambda" and multi-tier alerts in your architecture.

4. How do you translate a flood of cost data into actionable business decisions for engineering teams?
Hint: Reference your solution‚Äôs notification system (Discord/Slack alerts), dashboards, and how you‚Äôd summarize cost anomalies into next steps‚Äîsuch as decommissioning unused workloads or enforcing instance types.

5. What‚Äôs your approach to multi-environment (dev/staging/prod) deployments in Pulumi‚Äîwhy is this critical for FinOps and DevOps?
Hint: Talk about stack isolation and per-environment secrets. Mention how this prevents cascading cost and security failures, and how branching/deployment policies were enforced.

6. Reserved Instances, Savings Plans, and Committed Use Discounts: When do you use them? What‚Äôs the catch?
Hint: Compare AWS Reserved Instances and GCP Committed Use Discounts. Think about predictable (steady-state) versus spiky workloads. What pricing models fit best, and where do you see risk (commitment vs flexibility)?

7. Imagine a GCP migration: How do you map AWS resources to GCP equivalents for FinOps automation?
Hint: Reference your table mapping (EventBridge ‚Üí Eventarc, SNS ‚Üí Pub/Sub, Lambda ‚Üí Cloud Functions, Billing alarms ‚Üí Budgets/Notifications). Discuss potential differences in cost modeling, alerting, and access controls.

8. Security: How do you ensure cloud cost monitoring doesn‚Äôt expose or leak sensitive financial or service data?
Hint: Mention use of IAM least-privilege roles, encrypted secrets (Pulumi configs), and secure handling of webhook URLs for notifications. Relate this to compliance and auditability requirements.

9. What are the main KPIs or metrics you‚Äôd monitor for a cloud cost control solution, and how would you report them?
Hint: Think beyond ‚Äútotal cost‚Äù‚Äîinclude cost by environment, rate of growth, alarm triggers, anomaly detection, unused resource counts, notification volume, and savings achieved.

10. Scenario: Accidental mass resource deletion‚Äîhow does your project prevent, identify, and recover from this?
Hint: Use your experience with Pulumi preview, resource name strategies, version control (backups), and explain the recovery workflow.

‚úÖ For Each Question:
Use your project reference guide (PDF/Markdown) to recall exact architecture and troubleshooting steps.

Map your answers to real lessons learned and fixes you applied‚Äînot just theory.

When stuck, use reference docs (Pulumi, AWS/GCP, FinOps.org) for specific implementation details.
